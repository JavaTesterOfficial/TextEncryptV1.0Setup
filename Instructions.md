# Instructions
To install the application, go to this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PjhMD7fc0hDQYxH-37aptOEsKrthq0-c?usp=sharing
Select the file "TextEncryptSetup.exe", right click it, and click download. Once it finished downloading, double-click it. 
Follow the rest of the instructions on the installer, and click yes if a user account control popup appears.
Once you finish installing, go to the windows search bar, type in "TextEncrypt", and click on a page looking icon. This will run a vbs script that launches the application.

# If you have java installed
If you have java installed on your system, you can download "TextEncryptSetup.jar", open the file, and hit install.
To check if you have java installed, go to the windows search bar, type in "About java", and if any application is listed called "About java", hit enter, and check the version. If it says version 8 or above, you should be able to run the univeral jar file. If no application is listed, you do not have java installed.
If you don't have java installed, please download the .exe file for windows. Linux and Mac is currently not supported for running TextEncrypt, but is currently planned on being supported.

# Why install java
When having java installed, it is much faster and easier to run java programs. When running the text encrypt installer that uses the .exe format, we need to extract it to a location with a java compiler to add support for java programs. When a user has java installed, you just have to double-click a jar file and you can immediately run the installer without extracting the file.
