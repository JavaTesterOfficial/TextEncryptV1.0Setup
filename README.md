# About the program
TextEncrypt is an open-source java program I made that allows a user to utilize DES encryption and decryption to encrypt and decrypt plain text with a password. Please note that this program was made a while ago and I only just recently wrapped it and exported the program as a self-extractor installer

# Requirements
In order to run the setup and install the program, you must meet these minimum requirements
- A 64-bit processor and operating system
- Windows 7 or later
- 500 MB of extra memory to utilize (you really only need 465 MB, but 500 just in case :) )
- That's it
