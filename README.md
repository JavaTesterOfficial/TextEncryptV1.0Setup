# About the program
TextEncrypt is an open-source javafx program I made that allows a user to utilize DES encryption and decryption to encrypt and decrypt plain text with a password. Please note that this program was made a while ago and I only just recently wrapped it and exported the program as a self-extractor installer

# Installer
You can download the installer here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PjhMD7fc0hDQYxH-37aptOEsKrthq0-c?usp=sharing

# Requirements
In order to run the setup and install the program, you must meet these minimum requirements
- A 64-bit processor
- Windows 7 or later
- 500 MB of extra storage to utilize (you really only need 465 MB, but 500 just in case :) )
- That's it

# Cool things about this program
1. You don't need java or javafx to install this application. We already include a java compiler inside the application directory and you can run the installer without java installed 
2. It is simplistic
3. The encryption mechanism is so unique that even des encryptors and decryptors online cannot decrypt it with the right password, even if you tweak the settings a lot. So it is really hard to use DES encryption crackers to decrypt the encrypted text from this program
4. This program was originally inspired by a program called keepass, where you can encrypt a file containing your passwords in the form of entries, and only read your passwords with a master password. Eventually, I realized I did not have the skill to make the code to add entries, read those entries, and delete those entries. So I decided to make it so that you could only encrypt and decrypt plain text.
5. I cannot take all the credit as I looked up a lot of the code and copy-pasted them. I don't remember the sources I used, but the program is still pretty cool. (Also, I now have to ability to program this by memory -htmltesterofficial from 7/19/2025)
6. This code is open-source. That means you can redistribute it all you want, modify it all you want, and whatever you want to do. You don't have to give me credit, but it would really be appreciated :).

# Disclaimer!
- This program is not malicious. It is open source, so you can inspect the code and check for malicious code. You can do whatever you need, I can guarantee you it is not malicious. If you believe it is, please contact me, and include any piece of malicious code you found, and I will look into it.
- I could not upload the exe installer because it is 400 MB in size. So I need you to download the program from a link. 

# Thank you
Thanks for using this program. Creating an installer for this program took 2 weeks, and I really would like it if someone tested this code :D. I hope to be a programmer one day, and testers like you are really helpful.

# Installing the program
To install the program, please navigate to Instructions.md on this github repository and follow the instructions listed. Or, you can just click on the link on the installer section above without any instructions, but it should be relatively easy either way.
